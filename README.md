# Biblity-Project

## Description 

Biblity is not just a book finder â€” it's your personalized literary companion! With Biblity, you can effortlessly search for any book your heart desires. Simply type in the title or author and watch as a treasure trove of books unfolds before your eyes. But Biblity doesn't stop there. We understand that discovering the perfect book is only half the journey. That's why we've incorporated a review feature, allowing you to share your thoughts and insights on any book you've read. 


## Technologies Used 

In our project, we used node.js and express.js to create a restful API. Handlebars.js were also used to create dynamic web pages. 
Programming languages used to develop this project is HTML, Javascript and SQL.
PostgreSQL and sequelize were used to manage our data effectively. 
Our API can fetch and add data with GET and POST routes.
